                <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
                <p>
                  Startups face friction at every stage: launching too slowly, scaling inefficiently, burning through runway on infrastructure costs, getting slowed down by technical debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We remove that friction. With years of startup experience, we know what works at each stage - whether you&apos;re launching your MVP, iterating toward product-market fit, scaling to handle growth, or optimizing to reduce costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our mission is simple: work alongside founders in a cofounder-like style to accelerate their journey, without the enterprise overhead or hiring delays.

              <p>
                Our team has worked with startups across different stagesâ€”from pre-seed to Series A. We&apos;ve launched MVPs in weeks, helped companies scale from thousands to millions of users, and reduced infrastructure costs by 60%+ through smart optimization.

                We know what friction looks like at each stage, and how to remove it. This isn&apos;t theoretical knowledge - it&apos;s hard-won experience from being in the trenches, solving real problems, and helping founders succeed.
